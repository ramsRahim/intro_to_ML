### Description:
1. Generate a three class gaussian data using sklearn.dataset library as shown below:
```py
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs  
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 500, centers = 3, cluster_std = [1.0,1.5,2.0], random_state = 0)
```   

2. Split train data in 80:20 (Train: Test) and to perform training and evaluation.   
3. Apply Gaussian Naive Bayes Algorithm with 80 percent train dataset.     
4. Not allowed to use any built-in library to make Na√Øve Bays model, implementation should be your own.      
5. Then test your algorithm with the 20 percent evaluation dataset.     
6. Report the accuracy of classification on the test dataset.
