### Description:
Un-supervised Learning. Please refer [provided notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KcWP3-cKTrBsbqGetmRbnUUijjXnRoho?usp=sharing)    
1. In the provided notebook there is a dataset.    
2. Remove the labels from the dataset to make the number of classes unknown and plot the unlabeled data again.    
3. Apply K-means clustering algorithm on the created unlabeled dataset.    
4. Implement your own k-means clustering algorithm and do not use any built-in library.    
5. Vary K from 2-9 and evaluate the k-means algorithmâ€™s performance based on any Quantitative evaluation metric of k-means of your choice.     
6. Plot the K vs performance.
7. Label the dataset again with k of your choice and plot it.
