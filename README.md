# Description:
1. Get the data: Take any number of years data of price of a Ford Ranger (Min-Max): Ford Ranger Models, Generations & Redesigns | Cars.com
2. Run two linear regression model (one for minimum price and one for maximum price). Plot your loss curve for 100 iterations for both the cases.
3. You will notice that on the given URL that the prices from year 2012 to 2018 is missing. Your job is to predict the price of the Ranger in those years if Ford would have decided to launch its Ranger models in those years as well.
4. What are final values of Theta (Weights) after training?
5. Plot the year to price curve with predicted values of the missing (2012 to 2018) years.
6. Repeat the above process with feature scaling and dynamic learning rate.
7. Plot the loss curve again. Did you see any improvements?
8. What would be the possible price range for year 2012 to 2018 Ranger for this type of training with feature scaling and dynamic learning rate.
9. Plot the year to price curve with predicted values of the missing (2012 to 2018) years in this case as well.
