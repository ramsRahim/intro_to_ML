## Part-1:
1. Use 3 Deep Learning Models to perform classification of CIFAR-10 dataset. [30 Points]
2. Please refer: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html , to know how to load CIFAR-10 Dataset in pytorch.
3. In CIFAR10 there are 50000 images in training dataset and 10000 images in test dataset.
4. Split train data in 80:20 (Train: Validation) and perform 5-fold validation. [20 Points]
5. Report the Training Time, model size and training accuracy for all 3 models. [10 Points]
6. Select 1 best model out of these 3 and report test accuracy as well as draw confusion matrix. [10 Points]  

## Part-2:
Choose at least Three hypotheses, test them, and explain why they are correct or wrong.
Following are some example hypotheses: [30 Points]
1. Increase/decrease the model size/complexity will improve performance (justify) (test) (yes/no) (explain)
2. Increase/decrease the batch_size (justify) (test) (yes/no) (explain)
3. Increase/decrease input sample size for training (justify) (test) (yes/no) (explain)
4. Change the model, which model? (justify) (test) (yes/no) (explain)
5. Needs more regularization for better training. (justify) (test) (yes/no) (explain)
