## Description

1. Get the data: Get the data and data description from the UCI repository about characteristics for 3 different flowers: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris
2. Data contains 4 specifications:
• sepal length in cm
• sepal width in cm
• petal length in cm
• petal width in cm
3. It has three types of outputs as flower names: “Iris-setosa” , “Iris-versicolor” and “Iris-virginica”.
4. Make a logistic regression model using two features (for example: “sepal length” and “sepal width”) as input and any two flowers (for example “Iris-setosa” and “Iris-virginica”) as binary classifiable output.
5. The repository has 4(3 input and 1 output) features and 150 rows, as per instructions in step 4 the data you select will be 3(2 input and 1 output) features and 100 rows.
6. Plot the input and output data you selected for your model, clearly showing the data distribution.
7. Split your data in 80:20 (Train : Test) form, train your model with 80 Train data and plot the accuracy percentage on train data vs number of epochs.
8. After the model is trained, test the model with test data and report the accuracy percentage with test data.
9. Feel free to use any value of weights and any learning rate, report your weights after the training.
